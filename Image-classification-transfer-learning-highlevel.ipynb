    "Welcome to our end-to-end example of distributed image classification algorithm in transfer learning mode. In this demo, we will use the Amazon sagemaker image classification algorithm in transfer learning mode to fine-tune a pre-trained model (trained on imagenet data) to learn to classify a new dataset. In particular, the pre-trained model will be fine-tuned using custom dataset created before. \n",

    "To get started, we need to set up the environment with a few prerequisite steps, for permissions, configurations, and so on.\n",

    "This ipython notebook is copied by SageMaker example, we change the origin public dataset as our custom dataset (use crawler.py to get the images and create the recordIO file). You can read these script files for more details and learn how to build your own dataset and train your own model as a fast and accurate way if you have no ML experience."
